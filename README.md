Mapping the effect of November wildfires on air quality in Atlanta
---

This project uses the [AirNow api](https://docs.airnowapi.org/HistoricalObservationsByLatLon/docs) (signup required) to generate a 9x9 tile grid that can be superimposed over Atlanta and color-coded to show air quality in different areas of the city. Could be edited for higher resolution, but the user should bear in mind that AirNow has some pretty strict rate limits.
